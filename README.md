# search-app-es6

In February 2019 I visited the city of Salvador in the state of Bahia. This inspired me to build an app that exposes the list of cities (not comprehensive) in Brazil. I hope to go back some time soon!

Another inspiration for this feature is the exploration of a simple view without use of a framework (we don't ALWAYS require the complexity). It mimics some of the niceties of React such as:

- one-way data binding to child components using `renderChildView`
- component based architecture

What I would like to add:

- unit tests for each component and their methods
- perhaps there is a cleaner rendering strategy than running `replace` on template strings
- sorting for results
- any suggestions?

## Step 1

git clone git@github.com:natalieolivo/search-app-es6.git && cd search-app-es6

## Step 2

npm install

## Step 3

npm run dev

You should be able to reach the app running at http://localhost:1234
